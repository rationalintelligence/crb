The **CRB framework** is a new approach to creating modular asynchronous applications in Rust, allowing you to build truly large applications.

To support the project, subscribe to [Knowledge.Dev](https://knowledge.dev/) â€“ interactive lessons for learning idomatic Rust. The reader application itself uses these actors for both the backend and the UI.
